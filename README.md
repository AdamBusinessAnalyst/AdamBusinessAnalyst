## ⭐ Featured Projects

SkyTab POS Support Analysis (Python & SQL) | Self-Initiated Work Project

Goal: Analyze support ticket data to distinguish between "Hardware" (connectivity) vs. "Operational" (menu config) friction points.

Tech: Python (Pandas for cleaning), SQL (for volume aggregation).

Outcome: Quantified that printer connectivity issues take 3x longer to resolve than menu updates, validating the need for a specialized hardware support tier.

Goal: Analyze 90,000+ StackOverflow survey responses to identify high-value programming skills.

Tech: Python (Data Cleaning), IBM Cognos (Dashboarding).

Outcome: Built an interactive dashboard revealing that while Python is the fastest-growing language, SQL remains the most critical baseline skill for data roles.
